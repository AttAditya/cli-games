### Creating a new map

Before starting to create a new map, please read this guidelines.

- `maps.json` is the file that is responsible for holding all the maps. Note this is a `.json` file so you should be familiar with it's syntax.
- `maps` is the root node of our file. Therefore it is the place you have to add the map.
- The file doesn't follow a strict rule. Here is an example of how you can add a new story to the file

```json
    {
        "maps": [
            ...
            [
                ["♟", " "],
                [" ", "▣"]
            ],
        ]
    }
```

- <b>Note that you must enter the player character (`"♟"`) and the door (`"▣"`) into the map to make it a valid map</b>
- You can also specify walls using `"▉"` character.

- Enjoy!
